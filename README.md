📊 Bank Marketing Prediction using Decision Tree
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a bank product based on their demographic and behavioral data.
The model is built using the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
🧠 Problem Statement
Banks often run marketing campaigns to promote products. Predicting customer responses helps optimize these campaigns.
Objective:
Build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will purchase a product (yes or no) using customer attributes.
